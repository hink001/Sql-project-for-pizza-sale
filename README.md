# 🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project

## About This Project

This project shows my SQL practice using a **Pizza Sales dataset**. I solved different types of questions to improve my skills in data analysis and SQL queries. The goal is to understand sales, revenue, and customer order patterns.

All questions are solved using SQL and divided into three levels:

* Basic
* Intermediate
* Advanced

## 📂 Project Structure

Each SQL file contains queries related to specific questions. The questions are based on real business problems like revenue, popular pizzas, order time, and category performance.

You can find:

* Multiple SQL files with solved queries
* Well-organized code
* Easy-to-read comments inside queries
